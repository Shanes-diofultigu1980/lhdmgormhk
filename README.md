Just walked out of Kimge kereksin, and wow, my brain feels like it’s been on a rollercoaster through a flower shop during a sale on aphid-eaten roses. Can someone tell me what did I just 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩? I can't decide if I'm inspired or in desperate need of a nap. There I was, squished between some gum-chewing teenager and the world's loudest popcorn cruncher, asking myself existential questions about, you know, my relevance in the whole universe... and maybe why I'd picked the wrong career selling daisies.

The 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮 was like a surreal bouquet of emotions tied together with a string of awkwardly charming, albeit jagged, storytelling techniques. It threw genres together like I do random flowers in an end-of-day arrangement. Somehow, they kind of worked? Or maybe that's the sleep deprivation talking. It was almost like they asked, Who needs plot consistency when you can have unexpected dance numbers!

> The lead character—let's call him Mr. “Why am I even here”—made me question my life choices more than once. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 him stumble through the streets of some God-knows-where city, I was like, dude, EXACTLY. I mean, really, sometimes it’s like I’m staring into a mirror, except my hair doesn't look as good, and I’m more prone to trimming foliage than my existential crisis.

There was this scene that hit me hard, where he held a puppy like it was the Holy Grail and not a confused ball of fur. It spoke to me. Puppies: 1, Adult responsibilities: 0. Except, why was the puppy there, in the rain, under a neon sign about metaphors or something? Probably a statement about society I should get. I'll pretend I did.

Random thought—what was up with that moody music number that seemed to drag on longer than a Monday morning meeting? Could’ve sworn I heard it on loop in the elevator of confusing life choices, just vibing there. Or screaming.

Here, let me drop a piece of completely random C# code that I somehow remembered (or perhaps dreamt up?) during the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮:

```csharp
public string WhoNeedsLogicWhenYouHaveEmotion(Movie  ) =>  .IsConfusingYetCharming ? 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 again : 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 it maybe?;
```

By the end, I think it made me want to shuffle around my living room, contemplating 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 the   to try and make sense of it, or perhaps gather every odd thought and frame it against my own flawed version of logic. Should you 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it? Who knows?! Maybe bring a flower to sniff and ground you down during the emotional whirlwinds.

Time to go back to flower arranging now—it's so much simpler.
